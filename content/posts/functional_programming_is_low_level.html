title: Functional programming languages are low-level

Functional programming languages are said to be high level. Some are. Some - specfically Haskell - are not. The definition I'm using is not the technical one - distance from the machine - but in terms of the amount of time you require an average user to think about the problem.

## What is low level

  >  A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

Imagine the ideal programming language - it'd be entirely grown to describe your problem. This is what domain-specific languages, Paul Graham's [Programming Bottom Up](http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html) and Guy Steele's [Growing a Language](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0) are all about - making the language describe your problem succicenty, clearly and obviously.

Programming is about doing things for people. People want things to move, change, make noise, flash things on the screen, store things for ever, access the internet. Calling functions and transforming data are means to that end - in short, everything that users care about involves state and input-output at its core.

Haskell and other very ideological languages make both of these things a [puzzel](). For the programs you wish to write, you'll have to spent a huge amount of your time considering things that are irrelevant at that time.

## The language should fade away

Some languages fade into the background - Python, Ruby, perhaps Go. Some demand centre stage - like Haskell and Erlang. When you're solving a problem, the language should merely be the medium, not an additional irrelevent puzzle piece.

## You just haven't learned enough

Haskell strikes me as a
