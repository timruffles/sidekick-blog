Differences between your development and production environments are an evergreen source of bugs. Managing it with Chef lets you develop and test on the same OS, with the same packages, as you have in production.

## Tools

- Chef - define your production enviroment
- VirtualBox - run a virtual machine to run your production env
- Vagrant - script creation of virtual machines
- Tmux or screen (optional) - keep a persistant development environement

## Chef

Chef allows you to define your server configuration in code.

## VirtualBox &amp; Vagrant

Since you'll want to be able to quickly create and destroy development environments, it's best not to manage your actual OS with Chef. That implies virtualisation.

VirtualBox is a free virtual machine runner. 

## Tmux or screen

Another advantage of this setup if you use a terminal based editor like Vim or Emacs is being able to create persistant development environments.
