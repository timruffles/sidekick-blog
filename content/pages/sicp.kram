## Format

Bring a laptop, & any copies of the book etc you have. We'll be in touch via email to suggest the 3 exercises for the first week. You're welcome to choose your own too - we'll spend the time discussing the exercises that people found interesting. Afterwards: pub!

As said in the initial signup feel free to use any language you like. Phil & I (the organisers) will be using Clojure.
